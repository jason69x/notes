***real numbers*** -

a real number is a number that can be used to measure a continuous one-dimensional quantity such as duration or temperature. Here, continuous means that a pairs of values can have arbitrarily small differences.

***rational numbers*** - 

a rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction $p/q$ of two integers, a numerator p and a non-zero denominator q.
real numbers which are either terminating or repeating are rational's.

irrational numbers are real numbers which neither terminate or repeats.

*why are non-terminating repeating real numbers rational?* - 

because they can be represented as a fraction. let $x=0.666...$
multiplying both sides by 10 gives us $10x = 6.666...$ 
subtracting equation i from ii , we get
$9x = 6$ , thus $x = 6/9$ .

***imaginary numbers*** - 

a imaginary number is a product of a real number and a imaginary unit i, which is defined by its property $i^2=-1$ .
