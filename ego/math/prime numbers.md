***prime numbers*** - 

a natural number greater than 1 whose only positive divisors are 1 and itself *or* a number which cannot be written as a product of two smaller natural numbers. non-prime numbers greater than 1 are called composite numbers. 1 is neither prime nor composite.

mersenne prime , a prime number that is one less than a power of two. $M_n = 2^n -1$ .

***trial method for primality test*** -

to check whether a number $n$ is prime or not , check it's divisibility by natural numbers from 2 to $\sqrt{n}$ .

*why till $\sqrt{n}$ ?* , if we can express n as a product of two natural number's then at least one of them should be less than $\sqrt{n}$ , otherwise their product will be greater than $n$ .
