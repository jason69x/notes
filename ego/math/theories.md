**Russell's paradox** - 

It shows that every set theory that contains an unrestricted comprehension principle leads to contradictions. According to unrestricted comprehension principle, for any sufficiently well-defined property, there is a set of all and only objects that have that property.

Let R be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. if R is not a member of itself then it should be in R but if its in R then its a member of itself. this resulting contradiction is russell's paradox.

Let $R = \{x |x \notin x\}$ . Then $R \in R \iff R \notin R$
