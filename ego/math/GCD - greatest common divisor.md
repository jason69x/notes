$gcd(0,0)=0$

there is no greatest integer such that it divides 0. if greatest is considered in the context of divisibility relation then 0 is the greatest element.

common divisors of a and b are exactly the divisors of their gcd.

#divide_by_0

$x/0$ where x is non-zero is undefined because for any integer $n*0$ is $0$ , therefore a integer which when multiplied by 0 that divides x doesn't exists.

$0/0$ , in this case any number can satisfy $0 = 0*n$ . therefore, it is **undefined**.

**Bezout's identity -** 

*let a and b be integers with greatest common divisor d , there exists integers x and y such that $ax+by=d$ . the integers of the form $ax+by$ are exactly the multiples of d.*

**Euclid's Lemma -** 

*if a prime number $p$ divides product of two integers $ab$, then $p$ must divide at least one of $a$ and $b$.*

#coprime

**coprime** - 

*two integers $a$ and $b$ are coprime if the only positive integer that is  a divisor of both $a$ and $b$ is $1$.
or their **gcd** is 1.
the number of integers coprime to a positive integer $n$ is given by [Euler's totient function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function)* .

**prime factorization theorem** -

*every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers.*

1 is not prime because prime factorization of 1 is not unique (if we assume $1$ to be prime).
