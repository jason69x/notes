smallest number of colors needed to get proper vertex coloring (no two adjacent vertices have the same color) is called the ***chromatic number*** of the graph, written $\chi(G)$ .

***planar graphs*** - graphs that can be drawn without overlapping edges. every non-planar graph must have a $k_5$ or $k_3,_3$ as a subgraph.

*euler's equation* for planar graphs, $F + V = E + 1$ 

*polygon*, is a geometric shape that is made up of straight lines and it should not contain any curves or holes. polyhedra, $3d$ shapes with polygonal faces. every polyhedron shape can be represented as a planar graph.

*the four color theorem*, if $G$ is a planar graph then the chromatic number of $G$ is $\leq4$ .

nobody knows whether an efficient algorithm for computing chromatic number exists.

*clique*, in a graph is a set of vertices all of which are pairwise adjacent.

***Brook's theorem*** - Any graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\leq\Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle, in which case $\chi(G)\leq\Delta(G)+1$ .

*edge coloring*, *chromatic index* - $\chi^{'}(G)$ 

***Vizing's theorem*** - For any graph $G$ chromatic index is either $\Delta(G)$ or $\Delta(G)+1$ .

*Ramsey Theory* - color every edge either red or blue without forming a monochromatic triangle.
