To learn spoken Japanese from scratch, focusing solely on speaking (pronunciation, fluency, conversation) and understanding (listening comprehension), consistency is crucial—aim for 30-60 minutes daily. This can lead to basic conversational skills in 3-6 months and intermediate fluency in 9-12 months with immersion. Skip reading/writing systems like hiragana or kanji; use romaji (Romanized Japanese) initially if needed, but transition to audio-only for natural learning. Prioritize repeating aloud, shadowing (mimicking native speakers), and real interactions. Track progress by recording yourself weekly and comparing.

Below is a detailed, phased plan using only free resources like apps (free tiers), podcasts, YouTube, and language exchanges. No textbooks or writing tools are included—everything is audio/visual-focused.
