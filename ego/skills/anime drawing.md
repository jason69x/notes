To learn how to draw anime girls from scratch and progress to a professional level, you'll need consistent practice—aim for at least 30-60 minutes daily. This isn't a quick process; it can take 6-12 months or more to reach advanced skills, depending on your dedication. Start with traditional pencil and paper if you're a complete beginner, then move to digital tools like free software (e.g., Krita or MediBang Paint). The key is to master fundamentals first, as anime is a stylized form of art built on real drawing principles. Focus on observation, repetition, and studying references from anime shows or manga.

Below is a detailed, phased plan using only free resources. I've prioritized accessible ones like YouTube tutorials, websites with step-by-step guides, and free online courses. No paid books, classes, or tools are included. Track your progress by keeping a sketchbook and redrawing old pieces every month to see improvement.

### Phase 1: Build Drawing Fundamentals (Weeks 1-4)
Before diving into anime, learn basic art skills like lines, shapes, shading, and human anatomy. Anime exaggerates these, but skipping fundamentals leads to wonky drawings. Practice simple exercises: draw straight lines, circles, and basic 3D shapes daily.

- **Key Topics to Cover:**
  - Grip and control: Loose sketching vs. precise lines.
  - Basic shapes and proportions: Break down objects into circles, squares, and triangles.
  - Shading and value: Use hatching or blending for light/shadow.
  - Human anatomy basics: Focus on head, torso, limbs (use stick figures at first).

- **Free Resources and Practice Plan:**
  - Watch and follow along with the YouTube channel "Draw like a Sir" for beginner fundamentals (e.g., videos on line control and basic shapes). Spend 1 week on lines and shapes.
  - Use the free tutorials on GVAAT's Workshop website for step-by-step guides on basic drawing (e.g., their 3-step guide to simple forms like ears, which applies broadly). Practice 20 sketches per day.
  - YouTube channel "markcrilley" has free beginner videos on realistic drawing basics that translate to anime (e.g., proportion tutorials). Dedicate Week 2 to head and face proportions.
  - For anatomy, watch "Sycra" on YouTube for free gesture drawing and simplified body breakdowns. Weeks 3-4: Draw 10 full-body stick figures daily, adding basic muscles.
  - Free course on Alison: Enroll in "Drawing Anime Characters – Full Features and Emotions" (intermediate but adaptable for basics)—start with modules on body features and practice simplifying real anatomy. Complete the body basics section in 1 week.

**Milestone:** By the end, you should be able to sketch a basic human figure without references looking distorted.

### Phase 2: Learn Anime Style Basics (Weeks 5-8)
Transition to anime's stylized elements: larger eyes, simplified features, and exaggerated proportions (e.g., heads are often 1/6 to 1/8 of body height). Focus on heads and faces first, as they're central to anime girls.

- **Key Topics to Cover:**
  - Anime proportions: Slimmer bodies, big heads.
  - Face construction: Circle base, guidelines for eyes/nose/mouth.
  - Simple poses and angles: Front view, then 3/4 view.
  - Basic expressions: Happy, sad (start neutral).

- **Free Resources and Practice Plan:**
  - Follow the free step-by-step guide on the Skillshare Blog: 1) Draw a circle with cross guidelines; 2) Add eyes (curved lids, iris/pupil); 3) Sketch hair in flowy chunks; 4) Add body with simple shapes; 5) Ink and detail. Practice this 5-step process 10 times daily in Week 5 for heads.
  - YouTube: Watch "The Fastest Way to Learn Anime Style Art" for a 3-step formula (observe, copy, create). Apply it to proportions in Week 6.
  - AnimeOutline website: Use their free beginner tutorials on anime heads and faces (e.g., step-by-step eye and hair drawing). Weeks 7-8: Draw 5 full faces from different angles.
  - YouTube channel "Kooleen": Free short tutorials on easy anime faces and making characters look cute/young. Practice expressions.

**Milestone:** Sketch a basic anime character (any gender) in a front-view pose that looks balanced.

### Phase 3: Focus on Drawing Anime Girls (Months 3-4)
Anime girls often have feminine features: softer faces, larger eyes, flowing hair, and curvy but stylized bodies. Emphasize details like eyelashes, clothing folds, and cute poses.

- **Key Topics to Cover:**
  - Feminine proportions: Narrow shoulders, wider hips, longer legs.
  - Eyes and hair: Big, shiny eyes; voluminous, spiky or wavy hair.
  - Bodies and clothing: School uniforms, dresses; add folds and movement.
  - Poses for girls: Graceful or dynamic (e.g., action or cute stances).
