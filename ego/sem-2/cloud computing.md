virtual machines -> have their own kernel, only share host hardware, host os is isolated
containers -> share host kernel

hypervisor - virtual machine monitor

lets say we have a powerful compute device, how can we use this device efficiently by allowing multiple users to harness its power.
hypervisor is a software layer, that sits on top of the compute host and virtualized all functions of compute device.

many virtual server instance that uses resources and hypervisor manages what data need to be send/read to which vsi.
