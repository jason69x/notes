state performance requirements of their systems and compare different alternatives to find the one that best meets their requirements.

- determining the optimal value of a parameter (system tuning)
- bottleneck identification
- workload characterization
- determining number & size of components (capacity characterization)
- predicting performance at future loads (forecasting)


*system* - any collection of hardware,software,firmware
*metrics* - criteria used to evaluate performance of the system
*workload* - requests made by the users of the system

to compare performance meaningfully, the metrics must reflect what each system in designed to optimize.
