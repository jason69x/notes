### 3. Distributed Task Scheduler Simulator

Develop a system simulating a distributed scheduler (like Kubernetes-lite) where a master assigns computational tasks (e.g., simulations or data processing) to workers, using queues and caching for efficiency.

# Distributed Scheduler (Kubernetes-lite) Project Plan

---

## Overview

This project aims to build a distributed scheduler system where a master node assigns computational tasks to multiple worker nodes. The system uses queues for task distribution and caching for efficiency, simulating a simplified Kubernetes scheduler.

---

## Stepwise Plan

---

### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Distributed Systems & Scheduling

- Study distributed systems fundamentals:
  - CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance)
  - Consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos) overview
  - Failure detection and fault tolerance
  - Master-worker architecture
  
- Learn task scheduling concepts:
  - Scheduling algorithms (round robin, priority, weighted)
  - Task queues and producer-consumer patterns
  
- **Resources:**
  - *Distributed Systems* by Tanenbaum (Chapters on coordination and scheduling)
  - Kubernetes scheduling documentation (overview)
  - MIT Distributed Systems lectures (YouTube)
  - *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann (for deeper understanding)

**Goal:** Grasp the fundamental concepts required to design a distributed scheduler.

---

### Step 2: Choose Your Tech Stack & Set Up Environment

- Choose programming language (Recommended: Go for concurrency and networking)
- Install tools:
  - Go compiler and IDE/editor (VSCode, GoLand)
  - Redis server (optional, for queues and caching)
  - Docker (optional, for containerizing workers)

**Goal:** Prepare your development environment to write concurrent, networked applications.

---

### Step 3: Implement a Basic Task Queue (Producer-Consumer Pattern)

- Create an **in-memory queue** using Go channels or equivalent.
- Write a **master program** that adds tasks to the queue.
- Write one or more **worker programs** that pull tasks from the queue, execute simulated computations, and report results back.

**Goal:** Understand how to dispatch tasks and collect results using basic concurrency.

---

### Step 4: Introduce Networking (RPC or REST)

- Separate master and workers into distinct processes (possibly on different machines).
- Implement communication between master and workers via:
  - gRPC (recommended)
  - or REST APIs
  
- Workers:
  - Request tasks from master
  - Send task completion status
  - Send periodic heartbeat signals to indicate availability

**Goal:** Enable distributed task execution over a network.

---

### Step 5: Use a Persistent Queue System (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ)

- Replace the in-memory queue with a **persistent message queue**.
- Master pushes tasks into the queue.
- Workers consume tasks from the queue and acknowledge completion.
- Implement retries for failed or timed-out tasks.

**Goal:** Build a robust and scalable task dispatch mechanism.

---

### Step 6: Add Caching Layer

- Use Redis or an in-memory cache to store results of previously completed tasks.
- Before scheduling a task, check the cache to avoid duplicate computation.
- Implement cache invalidation or expiration as necessary.

**Goal:** Improve efficiency by avoiding redundant work.

---

### Step 7: Implement Fault Tolerance & Worker Management

- Implement heartbeat monitoring: master detects failed or unreachable workers.
- Reassign tasks from failed workers to healthy ones.
- Add task execution timeouts and automatic retries.
- Implement logging and monitoring for debugging and reliability.

**Goal:** Ensure system reliability and resilience to failures.

---

### Step 8: Add Scheduling Policies

- Implement different scheduling algorithms:
  - Round robin
  - Priority-based
  - Load-aware scheduling (consider worker load or resource availability)
  
- Simulate resource constraints such as CPU and memory on workers.

**Goal:** Enhance task assignment logic for efficiency and fairness.

---

### Step 9: Containerize Workers (Optional)

- Package worker nodes inside Docker containers.
- Enable master to start/stop worker containers dynamically (simulate autoscaling).
- Learn Docker basics and container orchestration principles.

**Goal:** Practice modern deployment and isolation methods.

---

### Step 10: Polish & Extend

- Build a simple user interface or CLI to submit and monitor tasks.
- Add detailed logging, metrics collection, and dashboards.
- Explore multi-master setups with leader election for high availability.
- Study Kubernetes source code and similar projects (e.g., Nomad) for inspiration.
