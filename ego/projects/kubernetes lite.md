### Phase 1: Build Strong Foundations
Before diving into distributed scheduling, ensure you have a solid grasp of core concepts in operating systems, networking, and programming. These are essential for understanding how processes, resources, and communication work in a distributed environment. Aim for 4-6 weeks, depending on your prior knowledge. Focus on theory first, then apply it through small coding exercises.

#### Key Skills to Learn:
- Operating Systems: Processes, threads, memory management, file systems, and kernel basics.
- Networking: TCP/IP, sockets, HTTP/HTTPS, RPCs (e.g., gRPC), and basics of load balancing.
- Programming Language: Go is ideal since Kubernetes is built in Go, and it's great for concurrent and distributed applications. If you're comfortable with another language like Python or Java, you can adapt, but switch to Go for authenticity.

#### Resources:
- **Books**:
  - *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau (free online at osbook.com). Read chapters on virtualization, concurrency, and persistence for deep theoretical understanding.
  - *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* by James Kurose and Keith Ross (8th edition). Focus on application, transport, and network layers.
  - *The Go Programming Language* by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan. If new to Go, start here for syntax, concurrency (goroutines/channels), and error handling.
- **Online Courses/Tutorials**:
  - MIT's 6.824 Distributed Systems course (free on YouTube/OCW) – watch lectures on basics before moving to advanced topics.
  - Go by Example (gobyexample.com) – interactive tutorials for practical Go coding.
- **Practical Exercises**:
  - Build a simple multi-threaded server in Go using net package for socket programming.
  - Implement a basic HTTP server and client to handle requests/responses.
  - Experiment with process forking and threading in Go to simulate resource allocation.

### Phase 2: Master Containerization
Understand containers as the building blocks for what you'll schedule. Kubernetes schedules containers, so learn how they isolate processes, manage resources, and network. This phase should take 2-4 weeks. Theory: How containers differ from VMs. Practice: Build and run containers.

#### Key Skills to Learn:
- Container fundamentals: Namespaces, cgroups, union file systems.
- Docker: Building images, running containers, volumes, networking, and orchestration basics.
- Container runtimes: CRI-O or containerd (used in Kubernetes).

#### Resources:
- **Books**:
  - *Docker in Action* by Jeff Nickoloff and Stephen Kuenzli (2nd edition). Covers internals deeply with practical examples.
- **Online Courses/Tutorials**:
  - Official Docker Documentation (docs.docker.com) – Start with "Get Started" and "Docker 101 Tutorial" for hands-on labs.
  - YouTube: "Complete Docker Course - From BEGINNER to PRO" by Nana Janashia (free, ~4 hours, includes building multi-container apps).
  - Udemy: "Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide" by Stephen Grider (paid, but often on sale; focus on Docker sections first).
  - DataCamp: "How to Learn Docker from Scratch" guide (free articles with code snippets).
- **Practical Exercises**:
  - Install Docker and build a simple image from a Dockerfile (e.g., a Go web server).
  - Run multi-container setups with Docker Compose (e.g., a web app with database).
  - Experiment with resource limits (CPU/memory) and networking bridges to simulate isolation.

### Phase 3: Dive into Distributed Systems Concepts
Now focus on the "distributed" part: How systems handle coordination, failures, and consistency across nodes. This is crucial for a scheduler's fault tolerance and consensus. Allocate 4-6 weeks. Balance theory (e.g., CAP theorem, consensus) with code.

#### Key Skills to Learn:
- Core Concepts: Distributed consensus (Raft/Paxos), leader election, fault tolerance, eventual consistency, quorum.
- State Management: Key-value stores like etcd (used in Kubernetes for cluster state).
- Communication: gRPC for efficient RPCs, message queues (e.g., Kafka basics).

#### Resources:
- **Books**:
  - *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann. Excellent for practical deep dives into reliability, scalability, and data handling in distributed systems.
  - *Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms* by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Maarten van Steen (3rd edition). Covers theory with practical paradigms.
  - *Distributed Algorithms* by Nancy A. Lynch. More theoretical, focus on chapters about consensus and scheduling.
  - *Understanding Distributed Systems* by Roberto Vitillo. Practical and developer-focused.
  - *Distributed Computing with Go* by V.N. Nikhil Anurag. Hands-on with Go examples.
- **Online Courses/Tutorials**:
  - MIT 6.824 (full course on YouTube) – Labs involve building Raft-based systems.

- **Practical Exercises**:
  - Implement a simple Raft consensus algorithm in Go (follow MIT labs).
  - Build a distributed key-value store using etcd and Go.
  - Simulate failures: Write a program with multiple nodes that elect a leader and handle node crashes.

### Phase 4: Learn Scheduling Algorithms
Scheduling is the heart of your project – deciding where and when to run tasks based on resources. Study algorithms for resource allocation in distributed environments. 2-3 weeks.

#### Key Skills to Learn:
- Algorithms: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First, Priority Scheduling, Bin Packing (for resource fitting).
- Distributed Scheduling: Load balancing, affinity/anti-affinity, gang scheduling.
- Metrics: CPU, memory, GPU utilization; handling overcommitment.

#### Resources:
- **Books**:
  - *Handbook of Scheduling: Algorithms, Models, and Performance Analysis* edited by Joseph Y-T. Leung. Comprehensive on theory and models.
  - *Scheduling in Distributed Computing Systems: Analysis, Design and Models* by Deo Prakash Vidyarthi et al. Focuses on distributed aspects.
- **Online Courses/Tutorials**:

  - Use Python's PuLP library (via code_execution tool if needed) to model and solve scheduling optimization problems.

### Phase 5: Study Kubernetes Internals
Understand Kubernetes as a reference for your lite version. Focus on the scheduler, API server, controller manager, and etcd. 3-4 weeks.

  - Extend the default scheduler with a custom plugin (e.g., prioritize nodes by CPU).
  - Use kube-scheduler-simulator (from Kubernetes blog) to test scheduling decisions.

### Phase 6: Build Your Kubernetes-Lite Scheduler
Apply everything: Build iteratively over 6-8 weeks. Start simple (single-node scheduler), add distribution, then features like scaling and fault tolerance.

#### Key Skills to Apply:

  2. Implement core: API for pod creation, scheduler to assign nodes using bin-packing.
  3. Add distribution: Use Raft for leader election among scheduler instances.
  4. Handle failures: Monitor nodes with heartbeats, reschedule pods.
  5. Test: Deploy sample apps (e.g., web servers in containers), scale them.
  6. Advanced: Add custom metrics or auto-scaling.
