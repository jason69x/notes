This plan outlines how to acquire the required skills to build a voice AI assistant that can chat via voice, analyze screen context for comments, and feature a VTuber-style avatar with reactive emotions (inspired by Neuro-sama). The assistant will use technologies like NLP for conversation, speech processing for voice interaction, computer vision for screen analysis, and animation tools for the avatar.

The plan assumes basic programming knowledge (e.g., Python). If you're a beginner, start with Python tutorials on freeCodeCamp or Codecademy. Expect 6-12 months to complete, dedicating 20-30 hours per week. Focus on open-source tools for customization and privacy.

Key components:
- **Voice Chat**: Speech-to-Text (STT), NLP for responses, Text-to-Speech (TTS).
- **Screen Context**: Computer vision (CV) for screen capture and analysis (e.g., OCR, object detection).
- **VTuber Avatar**: 2D/3D rigging with emotion syncing based on sentiment analysis.
- **Integration**: Real-time multimodal system.

Use GitHub for project repositories, Hugging Face for pre-trained models, and communities like Reddit r/MachineLearning for support.
